/*
 * https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/scheduling.html
 * The main idea is that when a task is submitted, the executor will first try to use a free thread if the number of active threads is currently less than the core size. 
 * If the core size has been reached, then the task will be added to the queue as long as its capacity has not yet been reached. Only then, 
 * if the queueâ€™s capacity has been reached, will the executor create a new thread beyond the core size. If the max size has also been reached, then the executor will reject the task.
 * 
 * keep-alive setting determines the time limit (in seconds) for which threads may remain idle before being terminated. 
 * If there are more than the core number of threads currently in the pool, after waiting this amount of time without processing a task, excess threads will get terminated.
